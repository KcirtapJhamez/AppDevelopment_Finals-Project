                                <p>Situated a mile off-shore Uacon, Zambales lies a small hidden island that has a very fine white sand. The island is not yet fully developed as compared to other beaches, you will not see any hotels or housing facilities,. Cottages are for rent but they easily get fully booked during weekends . So in this case youâ€™ll need to bring your own tent if you wish to stay and spend the night with your family/friends in there.</p>
